# Type APP: README.md
## Part 1: An Overview
```shell
    $ cd type-app
    $ ls
    application.py  helpers.py        static/
    typeapp.db      requirements.txt  templates/
```


## Part 2: Configuring
I have already entered my API keys for both API, so no need to worry about getting your own key. As a warning, though, both of the APIs seem to allow quite limited API calls every month.

As you saw in part 1, I have a text file named requirements.txt where I specify the packages you would need to run this project. Please install all of the requirements.


## Part 3: Running
Everytime you would like to start the web server and run the web app, simply type the following two commands:
```shell
	$ cd type-app
	$ flask run
```
If that ran successfully, you would see a url like http://something-ide.cs50.xyz/ url. Click on that link. 


## Part 4: Walkthrough
