# Type APP: README.md
## Running
Everytime you would like to start the web server and run the web app, simply type the following commands:
```shell
	$ cd type-app
	$ pip install -r requirements.txt
	$ flask run
```
If that ran successfully, you would see a url like http://something-ide.cs50.xyz/ url. Click on that link.
